                C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell <br>
                Laboratories in 1972.It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason<br>
                for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.<br>
                C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is claimed that the gods created the computer language ‘C.’ C is sometimes referred <br>
                to as the “foundation language” of programming. Therefore, if you are familiar with the<br> 
                programming language ‘C,’ you will find it relatively easy to pick up on the concepts of <br>
                the other programming languages that use the ‘C’ notion.<br>


            </p>
            <p>Efficiency of code execution and simplicity have resulted in C directly or indirectly influencing<br>
               development of many languages including C++ which is C with classes, C#, D, Java, Limbo, JavaScript,<br>
                Perl, UNIX’s C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog. These languages use C in variable capacity: for<br> 
                instance, in Python, C is used for building standard libraries, while others like C++, Perl and PHP<br> 
                have syntax and control structures based upon C.<br>

                    Every single character above serves a purpose. If you type it incorrectly,<br> the program will not run. printf is a function that can output a line of text.
                     Notice the placement of the quotes and the semicolon.<br> Further, notice that the \n creates a new line after the words

                Both of these are programming language types, and one can use them for developing applications.<br> 
                There is a major difference between C and C++. The C language is a procedural one that provides <br>
                no support for objects and classes. On the other hand, the C++ language is a combination of <br>
                object-oriented and procedural programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                C is a Procedural Oriented language. It does not support object-oriented programming (OOP) features<br> 
                such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance programming. C++ is both a procedural and an <br>
                object- oriented programming language. It supports OOP features such as polymorphism, encapsulation,<br> 
                and inheritance.
            </p>
            <h3>Simiilarities between C and CPP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Both languages have the same code structure.</li>
                <li>They both have a similar syntax.</li>
                <li>They both have a similar compilation.</li>
                <li>Their basic memory model is very close to the hardware.</li>
                <li>Similar notions of heap, stack, static, and file-scope variables are present in both of these languages.</li>

                Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.<br>
                In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), <br>
                for example:<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            <code>int</code> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123<br>
            <code>float</code> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99<br>
            <code>char</code> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes<br>

                For numbers, we will usually use the type int. On most computers today,it is a <br>
                32-bit number,which means the number can range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.<br>
                To define the variables foo and bar, we need to use the following syntax:<br>
            </p>

            <code>int foo;<br>
                int bar = 1;</code>
        </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                Arrays are special variables which can hold more than one value under the same variable name,<br>
                organised with an index. Arrays are defined using a very straightforward syntax:<br>

                <code>/* defines an array of 10 integers */
                    int numbers[10];</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                Accessing a number from the array is done using the same syntax. Notice that arrays in C are <br>
                zero-based, which means that if we defined an array of size 10, then the array cells 0 through <br>
                9 (inclusive) are defined. numbers[10] is not an actual value.<br>
            </p>
            <code>
                int numbers[10];

/* populate the array */
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;
numbers[3] = 40;
numbers[4] = 50;
numbers[5] = 60;
numbers[6] = 70;

/* print the 7th number from the array, which has an index of 6 */
printf("The 7th number in the array is %d", numbers[6]);
            </code>
